![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/@passmarked/spellcheck.svg) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/passmarked/spellcheck.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/passmarked/spellcheck)

[Passmarked](http://passmarked.com) is a suite of tests that can be run against any page/website to identify issues with parity to most online tools in one package.

The [Terminal Client](http://npmjs.org/package/passmarked) is intended for use by developers to integrate into their workflow/CI servers but also integrate into their own application that might need to test websites and provide real time feedback.

All of the checks on [Passmarked](http://passmarked.com) can be voted on importance and are [open-sourced](http://github.com/passmarked/suite), to encourage community involvement in fixing and adding new rules. We are building the living Web Standard and love any [contributions](#contributing).

## Synopsis

The module firstly checks if any language tag is present, if none presents a rule and skips the actual checking. If the language tag is present, the chosen dictionary is loaded and checked.

The rules checked in this module are:

* **unknown** - The given language was not in the list of valid BCP 47 language tags.
* **title** - Mistake found in the title of page
* **description** - Mistake found in description of the page
* **keywords** - Mistake found in page keywords
* **body** - Mistake found in body of the page from elements h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6,p,li,a

## External Services

The module was built with the idea to first run through local dictionaries that would catch 90% of the spell checking issues. The problem happens when the dictionaries hit newer words such as **DDOS**. 

To counter this [Passmarked](https://passmarked.com?source=github&repo=spellcheck) maintains a dictionary generated by all of the users.

This module will call a external HTTP service with each mistake found if the environment variable `SPELLCHECK_API_URL` is defined. 

The request will contain:

* `word` - The word that has been identified as wrongly spelled
* `token` - Value of environment variable `SPELLCHECK_API_KEY` to help prevent abuse, if required.

The request will then expect one of the following keywords back:

* `OK` - If the mistake was a false-positive and is found in the dictionary
* `BAD` - The given word was correctly marked as *bad* and should be reported
* `ERR` - Something went wrong while checking the global dictionary

## Running

The rules are checked every time a url is run through Passmarked or our API. To run using the hosted system head to [passmarked.com](http://passmarked.com) or our [Terminal Client](http://npmjs.org/package/passmarked) use:

```bash
npm install -g passmarked
passmarked --filter=spellcheck example.com
```

The hosted version allows free runs from our homepage and the option to register a site to check in its entirety.
Using the Passmarked npm module (or directly via the API) integrations are also possible to get running reports with all the rules in a matter of seconds.

## Running Locally

All rules can be run locally using our main integration library. This requires installing the package and any dependencies that the code might have such as a specific version of OpenSSL, see [#dependencies](#dependencies)

First ensure `passmarked` is installed:

```bash
npm install passmarked
npm install @passmarked/spellcheck
```

After which the rules will be runnable using promises:

```javascript
passmarked.createRunner(
  require('@passmarked/spellcheck'), // this package
  require('@passmarked/ssl') // to test SSL
).run({
  url: 'http://example.com',
  body: 'body of page here',
  har: {log: {entries: []}}
}).then(function(payload) {
  if (payload.hasRule('secure')) {
    console.log('better check that ...');
  }
  var rules = payload.getRules();
  for (var rule in rules) {
    console.log('*', rules[rule].getMessage());
  }
}).catch(console.error.bind(console));
```

Alternatively, callbacks are also available:

```javascript
passmarked.createRunner(
  require('@passmarked/spellcheck'),
  require('@passmarked/ssl'),
  require('@passmarked/inspect')
).run({
  url: 'http://example.com',
  body: 'body of page here',
  har: {log: {entries: []}}
}, function(err, payload) {
  if (payload.hasRule('secure')) {
    console.log("better check that ...");
  }
  var rules = payload.getRules();
  for (var rule in rules) {
    console.log('*', rules[rule].getMessage());
  }
});
```

## Dependencies

The module pulls all available dictionaries from the system that are myspell/hunspell compatible. The module also calls the native module of hunspell to handle parsing and validating the words/grammar given.

For the basics the following must be installed, this will only check the default language on the system:

```bash
apt-get install -y aspell hunspell
```

Additional languages can then be added by installing the preferred dictionary, these dictionaries only need to be myspell/hunspell compatible. The Debian/Ubuntu apt repo already contains numerous dictionaries ready for use. 

Feel free to install of the following for example:

```bash
apt-get install -y hunspell-an
apt-get install -y hunspell-de-de
apt-get install -y hunspell-fr
apt-get install -y hunspell-fr-comprehensive
apt-get install -y hunspell-ar
apt-get install -y hunspell-ru
apt-get install -y hunspell-be
apt-get install -y hunspell-se
apt-get install -y hunspell-br
apt-get install -y hunspell-en-ca
apt-get install -y hunspell-en-med
apt-get install -y hunspell-en-us
apt-get install -y hunspell-eu-es

apt-get install -y myspell-en-gb
apt-get install -y myspell-nl
apt-get install -y myspell-nr
apt-get install -y myspell-sw
```

We also recommend you install dictionaries from the SCOWL project, [Passmarked](https://passmarked.com?source=github&repo=spellcheck) hosts a build for local build servers as well - [package.passmarked.com/dictionaries/scowl-20160910.zip](https://package.passmarked.com/dictionaries/scowl-20160910.zip).

The libraries can be installed using:

```
mkdir -p /Library/Spelling
wget -O /tmp/build.zip https://package.passmarked.com/dictionaries/scowl-20160910.zip
unzip /tmp/build.zip -d /Library/Spelling
rm /tmp/build.zip || true
```

`/Library/Spelling` is checked as a location for libraries by default for Hunspell and Aspell (mySpell).

## Rules

Rules represent checks that occur in this module, all of these rules have a **UID** which can be used to check for specific rules. For the structure and more details see the [Wiki](https://github.com/passmarked/passmarked/wiki) page on [Rules](https://github.com/passmarked/passmarked/wiki/Create).

> Rules also include a `type` which could be `critical`, `error`, `warning` or `notice` giving a better view on the importance of the rule.

## Contributing

```bash
git clone git@github.com:passmarked/spellcheck.git
npm install
npm test
```

Pull requests have a prerequisite of passing tests. If your contribution is accepted, it will be merged into `develop` (and then `master` after staging tests by the team) which will then be deployed live to [passmarked.com](http://passmarked.com) and on NPM for everyone to download and test.
