Although not that widely used anymore in searh engines, `keywords` can provide more tags for searching. It is thus important that these keywords are spelled correctly.

Spelling mistakes were found in the:

```
<meta name="keywords" content="" />
```

tag of the page.

# How do I fix this?

Edit the source code that generates the HTML page containing the spelling error.

```
<html>
  <head>
    <meta name="keywords" content="" />
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```
